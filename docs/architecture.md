# Architectural Rules & Guidelines

This module adheres to the **Laraxot Architecture** and **Super Cow Methodology**.

For strict coding standards, Filament extension rules, and PHPStan guidelines, please refer to the central documentation in the **Xot Module**:

-   [Super Cow Methodology](../../xot/docs/super_cow_methodology.md)
-   [PHP Quality Guide](../../xot/docs/php_quality_guide.md)
-   [Filament Extension Rules](../../xot/docs/filament-extension-rules.md)

**Key Principles:**
1.  **DRY & KISS**: Don't repeat yourself, keep it simple.
2.  **Zero Errors**: PHPStan Level 10 compliance is mandatory.
3.  **XotBase**: Always extend `XotBase` classes, never Filament classes directly.
4.  **Translations**: Use `LangServiceProvider` for automatic label resolution.
# Notify Module Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architectural design of the Notify module, focusing on its structure and integration points within a Laravel application.

## Key Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component of the Notify module handles a specific aspect of notification management.
2. **Flexibility**: Designed to support multiple notification channels and providers with ease.
3. **Scalability**: Built to handle increasing notification volumes through queueing and optimization.

## Architecture Components
### 1. Core Components
- **Notification Service**: Central service for handling notification logic and dispatching.
- **Channel Providers**: Interfaces for different notification channels like email, SMS, etc.
- **Template Engine**: Manages notification content formatting and rendering.

### 2. Integration Points
- **Laravel Integration**: Hooks into Laravel's event system and queue for notification triggering and processing.
  ```php
  // Example Event Listener for Notification
  class UserRegisteredListener
  {
      public function handle(UserRegistered $event)
      {
          $event->user->notify(new WelcomeNotification());
      }
  }
  ```

### 3. Data Flow
- Notifications are triggered by events or direct calls, processed by the notification service, and sent via the appropriate channel provider.

## Common Issues and Fixes
- **Integration Errors**: Ensure event listeners are properly registered to trigger notifications.
- **Channel Configuration**: Verify provider configurations to prevent delivery failures.

## Documentation and Updates
- Document any architectural changes or new integration points in the relevant module's documentation folder.
- Update this document if significant changes are made to the Notify module architecture.
