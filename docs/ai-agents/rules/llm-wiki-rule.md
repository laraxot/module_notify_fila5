**Rule:** All modules and themes must contain a `docs/wiki/` directory (with compiled wiki pages) and the corresponding `llm‑wiki` scaffolding (templates, agents.md, etc.).

**Why:** The LLM‑wiki is the unified documentation source; missing folders break the wiki build and QMD indexing.

**How to apply:** When creating a new module or theme, add the `docs/wiki/` folder (including `index.md`, `log.md`, and any overview files) and the `docs/llm-wiki/` support files before committing.
