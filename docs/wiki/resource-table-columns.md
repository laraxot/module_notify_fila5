# Resource table columns

## BMAD story and evidence

As an administrator I need identifiable records and operational state without oversized technical columns. Acceptance: string-keyed `array<string, Column>`, fields backed by models and migrations (or Sushi schemas), sortable dates, optional technical details.

NotificationLog uses channel/status/notifiable identifiers rather than name. Notification migrations guarantee type, notifiable pair, read_at/data; status and sent_at only in PHPDoc are insufficient evidence. Contact uses contact_type/value and first_name/last_name, not generic name/email/phone.

Sources: `app/Models`, `database/migrations`, existing resource `Pages/List*.php` and `Tables/*Table.php`. QMD query attempted before editing: unavailable because better-sqlite3 ABI 127 differs from Node ABI 147; direct source inspection used.
