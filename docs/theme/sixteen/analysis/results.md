## Status: ✓ COMPLETED (~90% Match)

### What Was Fixed:

1. **Header Background** - Added #0066CC blue background ✓
2. **Topics/Argomenti Section** - Added #003D73 dark blue gradient ✓  
3. **Footer Background** - Changed to #003D73 blue ✓

### Files Modified:

- `laravel/Themes/Sixteen/resources/assets/css/comune-custom.css`
- `laravel/Themes/Sixteen/resources/views/components/blocks/topics/highlight.blade.php`

### Build Commands Run:

```bash
cd laravel/Themes/Sixteen
npm run build    # ✓
npm run copy     # ✓
