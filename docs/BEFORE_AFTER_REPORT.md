# Before/After Report — Notify Module Docs

## Before
- docs/ contained: bmad/, legacy/ (447 files), wiki/, rules/, stories/, -integration/, readme.md files, images
- No single docs/README.md with BMAD frontmatter
- legacy/ mixed with active docs (archive not separated)
- BMAD frontmatter missing from most .md files
- No docs-archive-2026/ directory

## After
- legacy/ moved to docs-archive-2026/legacy/ (447 files preserved)
- docs/ reduced to active docs only (120 .md files)
- docs/README.md created with BMAD YAML frontmatter (index type, active status)
- BMAD YAML frontmatter applied to all remaining .md in docs/
- Archive isolated; active docs single directory
