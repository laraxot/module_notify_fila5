## File Count by Category

After consolidation (2026-10-06):

| Category | Files | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| bmad/ | 326 | Analysis, design, brainstorming, stories |
| wiki/ | 35 | Knowledge base and reference |
| phpstan/ | 35 | Quality analysis and fixes |
| architecture/ | 8 | Technical design |
| Other | 13 | Mail, SMS, deployment, reports, etc. |
| **Total** | **417** | |

## Consolidation History

**2026-10-06**: Initial consolidation phase
- Removed 19 duplicate and stub files (304 → 285 root files)
- Removed 8 stub directories (.obsidian, .schema, -integration, _integration, theme, superpowers)
- Moved specialized files into appropriate subdirectories
- Reduced root-level clutter from 304 files to 4 files

## Next Steps

Future consolidations may:
- Merge communication channel directories (mail, SMS, notifications) into a single `channels/` directory
- Consolidate analysis reports into `wiki/analysis/`
- Establish clear ownership and deprecation policy for old analysis files
