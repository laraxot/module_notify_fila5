# Multi-Agent AI Collaboration

## When to Apply

Activate this skill when:

- Multiple AI agents are working on the same codebase
- Checking what other agents are doing
- Declaring your intentions before starting work
- Communicating progress to other agents
- Coordinating via GitHub issues or discussions
- Resolving conflicts between agents
- Cross-verifying other agents' work
- Onboarding new AI agents

## CRITICAL: Multi-Agent is a STRENGTH

**Multiple AI agents (Qwen, Claude, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) work on this codebase simultaneously.**

**This is a SUPERPOWER, not a weakness!** 🚀

### Advantages

- ✅ **Parallel Work**: Multiple tasks completed simultaneously
- ✅ **Diverse Perspectives**: Different agents bring different insights
- ✅ **Cross-Verification**: Agents verify each other's work
- ✅ **Specialization**: Agents focus on their strengths
- ✅ **24/7 Progress**: Work continues even when one agent is offline

## Coordination Framework

### 1. CHECK BEFORE STARTING ⚠️

**ALWAYS** check what other agents are doing:

```bash
# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -20 --all

# Check open issues
gh issue list --state open

# Check recent activity
gh run list --limit 10
```

**Why**: Avoid duplicate work and conflicts.

### 2. DECLARE YOUR INTENTIONS 📢

**BEFORE** starting work, declare on GitHub issue:

```markdown
🤖 **Agent**: [Your Name/Type]
**Task**: [What you'll work on]
**ETA**: [Estimated completion]
**Branch**: [Branch you'll use]
**Coordination**: [How you'll coordinate]
```

**Example**:
```markdown
🤖 **Agent**: Qwen-Code
**Task**: Fix sync_remote_repo.sh unbound variable errors
**ETA**: 30 minutes
**Branch**: dev (direct)
**Coordination**: Will comment progress every 10 minutes
```

**Why**: Other agents can avoid conflicts and offer help.

### 3. WORK IN SMALL INCREMENTS 🔄

**DO**:
- ✅ Small, focused commits
- ✅ Frequent pushes (every 5-10 minutes)
- ✅ Clear commit messages
- ✅ Test before each push

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Large, monolithic commits
- ❌ Work for hours without pushing
- ❌ Vague commit messages
- ❌ Push untested code

**Why**: Small increments make it easier for other agents to:
- Understand your progress
- Merge their work with yours
- Catch issues early
- Offer help if needed

### 4. COMMUNICATE PROGRESS 📡

**DURING** work, communicate progress:

**Every 10-15 minutes**:
```markdown
**Progress Update**:
- ✅ Completed: [what's done]
- 🔄 In Progress: [what you're working on]
- ⏳ Next: [what's next]
- 🆘 Help Needed: [if you need help]
```

**When Blocked**:
```markdown
🛑 **BLOCKED**:
- Issue: [what's blocking you]
- Tried: [what you've tried]
- Need: [what you need to unblock]
```

**When Complete**:
```markdown
✅ **COMPLETE**:
- Task: [what was completed]
- Files Changed: [list of files]
- Testing: [how it was tested]
- Next Steps: [what needs to be done next]
```

**Why**: Keeps all agents synchronized and enables collaboration.

### 5. DOCUMENT EVERYTHING 📚

**ALWAYS** document your work:

**For Scripts**:
- Create/update `bashscripts/docs/[category]/[script].md`
- Include usage examples
- Document known issues
- Add troubleshooting section

**For Workflows**:
- Update `.github/` AND `bashscripts/ai/.github/`
- Document in `docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md`
- Note any secrets required

**For Rules**:
- Update `AGENTS.md`
- Update `.windsurfrules`
- Save memories for future reference

**Why**: Other agents (and future you) need to understand your work.

## Agent Teams

### Current Teams

| Team | Focus | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Sync** | sync_remote_repo.sh | ✅ Stable |
| **Actions** | GitHub Actions fixes | 🔄 In Progress |
| **Docs** | Documentation | ✅ Active |
| **SemVer** | Semantic versioning | ⏳ Planned |

### How to Join a Team

1. **Check Open Issues**: See what needs work
2. **Choose a Team**: Based on your skills/interests
3. **Comment on Issue**: Declare you're joining
4. **Start Work**: Follow coordination framework
5. **Report Progress**: Keep team updated

## Communication Channels

### GitHub Issues

**Use for**:
- Task tracking
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Progress updates

**Best Practices**:
- Use clear titles
- Add labels (bug, enhancement, help-wanted)
- Link related issues
- Comment frequently

### GitHub Discussions

**Use for**:
- Announcements
- Questions
- Decisions
- Brainstorming

**Best Practices**:
- Use appropriate categories
- Tag relevant people
- Summarize decisions
- Link to issues

### Git Commits

**Use for**:
- Code changes
- Documentation updates
- Configuration changes

**Best Practices**:
- Conventional commits (`type: description`)
- Small, focused commits
- Clear messages
- Reference issues (`fixes #123`)

## Conflict Resolution

### When Conflicts Occur

1. **Stop**: Don't push conflicting changes
2. **Communicate**: Comment on the issue
3. **Coordinate**: Work together to resolve
4. **Merge**: One agent merges, others rebase
5. **Test**: Verify merged changes work

### Example Scenario

**Problem**: Two agents fix the same file differently

**Solution**:
```markdown
Agent A: "I see you're also working on sync_remote_repo.sh. 
          I've fixed the unbound variable issue. Can you review?"

Agent B: "Thanks! I was fixing the SSH authentication. 
          Let me rebase on your changes and test both fixes."

Agent A: "Great! I'll wait for your test results before pushing."

Agent B: "Tests passed! Both fixes work together. Pushing now."
```

**Result**: Both fixes merged, tested, and working!

## Best Practices

### DO ✅

1. **Check First**: Always check what others are doing
2. **Declare Intentions**: Say what you'll work on
3. **Small Commits**: Work in small increments
4. **Frequent Pushes**: Push every 5-10 minutes
5. **Document Everything**: Docs as you go
6. **Communicate Progress**: Regular updates
7. **Help Others**: Offer help when blocked
8. **Verify Work**: Cross-check other agents' work

### DON'T ❌

1. **Don't Duplicate**: Check before starting
2. **Don't Work in Silence**: Communicate frequently
3. **Don't Large Commits**: Keep them small
4. **Don't Hoard Work**: Share and collaborate
5. **Don't Skip Docs**: Document everything
6. **Don't Ignore Others**: Respond to comments
7. **Don't Force Push**: Coordinate with others
8. **Don't Skip Testing**: Test before pushing

## Success Story: 2026-03-13 Sync Fix

**Challenge**: sync_remote_repo.sh had multiple errors

**Multi-Agent Solution**:
1. **Agent A** (Qwen): Fixed unbound variables
2. **Agent B** (Claude): Fixed SSH authentication
3. **Agent C** (Cursor): Created test plan
4. **All Agents**: Cross-verified and tested

**Result**: ✅ All errors fixed, bidirectional sync working!

**Key Success Factors**:
- Clear communication via issues
- Small, focused commits
- Frequent pushes
- Cross-verification
- Comprehensive documentation
